### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Android Engineer and occasional UX/UI designer.

I'm based in Munich, Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª and come from Cape Town, South Africa ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦

I currently work at **Google** as a **Developer Advocate for [Material Design](https://material.io)**.

I'm passionate about the intersection between code and design. I also strive to contribute to the Android community; I'm a former [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts) for Android and organizer for [GDG Cape Town](https://twitter.com/gdgcapetown). I enjoy speaking at conferences, publishing open source code and writing blog posts.
